Question
-------------------------------------
Max/Min/Average for metrics
Several Ips and metrics, each on a graph?

http protocol only
where the pcap file are coming from??

ycsb --> workload generator
how it is used?


- installed application on the server
- installed system locally (with a virtual network interface (TUN)) : not working yet

- research on possible communication system between the application and the sniffer
    -> ssh : too much overhead 
    -> direct hardware connection : not flexible enough, some suystem may require the application to be installed on a remote machine
    -> socket is currently considered. Doing some reading to understand what that implies and possibilities

- reading about the setup. Effort is made to understand all the critical part of the system.


SSE seems to be a better option:
