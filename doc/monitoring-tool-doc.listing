\begin{DashedDefinition}{}
[The pthread_key_create() function shall create a thread-specific data key visible to all threads in the process.
Key values provided by pthread_key_create() are opaque objects used to locate thread-specific data. Although the same key value may be used by different threads, the values bound to the key by pthread_setspecific() are maintained on a per-thread basis and persist for the life of the calling thread.
