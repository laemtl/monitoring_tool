system queue pour active
loop only on active metrics

one thread per metric : in case a metric is slow, doesn't disturb the others

value int/double atomic


// in timer
data->int_step++;
data->int_step = 0;

data->stamp++;	


remove condition to skip packet if it is not the first (special signature)

check a protocol an get metrics for it in the frontend


where should we start the necryption
- port detection
- client/server is still available
Should we move the filter -> don't keep flow of untracked client ??

- we parse first packet in pairs soneed to be decrypted.

send all metrics separately
